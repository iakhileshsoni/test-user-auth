In this project I have done only the functionality of User's

1. Registration 
2. Login
3. Password Reset

Password Reset needs SMTP configuration and I'm unable to put it here so maybe be you won't be able to hit that url but logic is written in the views.py file.


How to run the project

1. Create a new virtual environment
2. install requirements.txt
3. Do migrations (if needed) 
4. then run the project
5. then test the endpoints
